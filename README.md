# GoogleHackthon

The world is changing faster than ever and continues to evolve due to factors like climate change, invasive species, pollution, human error, and waste. You are tasked with creating a solution that integrates Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas while improving the world in areas of sustainability and social responsibility.  

## Intro
We want to create an app that everyone has to act what they they saw one by one. And the last one has to guess what the riddle is.   
There are two teams compete with each other and the one with highest score will win.  
A team can win score by guessing the right answer.   
For example, the first one will receive an object name maybe is "Horse", so first one needs to try his best to let next person know what he saw by action instead of by words.
Every time, only two people will show on the screen, one is the giver and the other one is the receiver. The giver will be muted and the receiver needs to try to understand what the giver tries to let him know.  
For last receiver, he needs to guess the answer, if he answerd the right one "horse" then his team will get one score. Otherwise, his team got no score.  
In the end, two teams need to compare their scores and the one with higher score would win, while the other team will receive some punishments.
